# Why Awesome Vercel Alternatives Exists

## The Catalyst

Recent events have made many developers reconsider their deployment choices. When a platform's leadership takes controversial positions that conflict with your values, and simultaneously charges predatory prices, it's time to look elsewhere.

## The Problem with Vercel

### Pricing That Doesn't Make Sense
- **$400/TB bandwidth** when competitors charge $0
- **$20/developer seat** when you could have unlimited for free
- **6,000 build minutes** then pay extra (vs unlimited elsewhere)
- **Surprise bills** that can 10x overnight

### The Lock-in Strategy
- Proprietary configurations
- Platform-specific features
- Migration friction by design
- Vendor dependency

### Values Misalignment
When platform leadership takes positions that many developers find objectionable, continuing to fund them becomes an ethical choice. Your deployment dollars are votes for the future you want to see.

## The Solution: Freedom of Choice

This project provides alternatives that are:

✅ **95% Cheaper** - Stop funding yachts, start funding features  
✅ **Open Source Friendly** - Support platforms that give back  
✅ **Values Neutral** - Or aligned with open web principles  
✅ **Developer Owned** - You control your infrastructure  
✅ **Globally Accessible** - Not just for Silicon Valley  

## By The Numbers

### What Vercel Charges vs Reality

| Service | Vercel | Industry Standard | Markup |
|---------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Bandwidth | $400/TB | $5-20/TB | **2000%** |
| Compute | $0.000065/req | $0.0000002/req | **325x** |
| Team Seats | $20/user | $0 | **∞** |
| Build Minutes | $0.01/min | $0 | **∞** |

### Real Developer Impact

For a typical startup with 3 developers and moderate traffic:
- **Vercel**: $840/month ($10,080/year)
- **Alternatives**: $20/month ($240/year)
- **Savings**: $9,840/year

That's:
- 6 months of developer salary
- 1 year of office rent
- 100+ months of alternative hosting
