## 🔥 Why This Exists

Recent events have made many developers reconsider where their deployment dollars go. When platform leadership takes controversial positions that conflict with your values, and simultaneously charges **$400/TB** for bandwidth that costs **$0** elsewhere, it's time for alternatives.

**My story:** I was paying Vercel **$840/month** for a SaaS app. After migrating to Hetzner + Coolify, I now pay **€4.51/month** with better performance. That's a **99.4% reduction**.

This isn't just about money (though saving $10,000/year is nice). It's about:
- **Not paying $20/developer** when everyone else charges $0
- **Owning your infrastructure** instead of renting it at 100x markup
- **Supporting platforms** that align with open-source values
- **Voting with your wallet** against predatory pricing

## 💸 The Problem with Vercel

Let's look at the actual numbers:

| What Vercel Charges | Industry Standard | Their Markup |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **$400/TB** bandwidth | $5-20/TB | **2000%** |
| **$20/developer** seat | $0 | **∞** |
| **$0.000065/request** | $0.0000002/request | **325x** |
| **6,000 build minutes** | Unlimited elsewhere | **Artificial scarcity** |

For a typical startup (3 devs, 2TB bandwidth, 5M requests):
- **Vercel:** $840/month
- **Alternatives:** $5-50/month
- **You save:** $10,000+/year
